# DocumentUploader Module

## Overview
The DocumentUploader component has been refactored from a single 400+ line file into a modular, maintainable structure while preserving all functionality and designs.

## File Structure
```
DocumentUploader/
├── index.js               # Main exports
├── constants.js           # Configuration and constants
├── utils.js              # File utilities and validation
├── useDragAndDrop.js     # Drag & drop hook
├── useFileUpload.js      # File processing hook  
├── DropZone.jsx          # Upload area component
├── FileList.jsx          # File management component
├── ErrorDisplay.jsx      # Error handling component
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Benefits
- **Reduced complexity**: Main component now ~150 lines vs 400+
- **Better maintainability**: Each file has single responsibility
- **Improved testability**: Isolated functions and components
- **Enhanced reusability**: Hooks and components can be reused
- **Professional structure**: Demonstrates software engineering best practices
